**Project Title: Railway Reservation System**
Project Description:
ðŸ‘‰The Railway Reservation System is a terminal-based application that allows users to book and manage railway tickets. This project uses Object Oriented Programming in java.

ðŸ‘‰The project will consist of the following modules/Functionalities:

ðŸ‘‰Create an ArrayList where available stations are - Delhi, Jaipur, Prayagraj, and Mumbai

Project Should have below Functionalities-
Train Information: This module will provide information about the available trains based on the source and destination stations and the date of travel We just have 3 trains -

Train Name	Time	Passenger Strength	Train Number
Mumbai - Delhi	13:05	50	1010 (Mumbai Superfast)
Delhi - Jaipur	7:00	50	2013 (Delhi SuperFast)
Prayagraj - Delhi	10:00	50	3045 (Prayagraj EXP)
Seat Availability: This module will check the availability of seats on the selected train and display the available seats to the user.

Booking: This module will allow users to book seats on the selected train, using information such as passenger names and seat numbers.

Canceling: The user Should have the option to Cancel the booked ticket

Ticket Display: This module will display the details of the booked ticket, including the passenger names, seat numbers, train numbers, and fares.

Error Handling: This module will handle any errors that may occur during the operation, such as invalid input or trying to book a seat already reserved.

**Here's a short explanation of what each part of the code does:****

**Train Class:**

This class represents a train and its attributes, including name, source, destination, departure time, passenger strength, and train number.
A constructor is provided to create instances of trains.

**Ticket Class:**
This class represents a ticket, including passenger name, seat number, and train number.
A constructor is provided to create ticket instances.

**RailwayReservationSystem Class:**
This is the main class that contains the core logic of the reservation system.
It maintains two ArrayLists: trains to store train information and bookedTickets to store booked tickets.
It also tracks the seatCount representing the available seats.

**initializeTrains():**
Initializes the trains ArrayList with some sample train data.

**showTrainInformation(Scanner scanner):**
Takes user input for source and destination stations.
Displays train information for trains matching the given source and destination.

**checkSeatAvailability(Scanner scanner):**
Takes user input for a train number.
Calculates and displays the number of available seats on the specified train.

**bookTicket(Scanner scanner):**
Takes user input for a train number and passenger name.
Books a ticket if seats are available, updates bookedTickets, and decrements seatCount.

**cancelTicket(Scanner scanner):**
Takes user input for a train number and passenger name.
Cancels a booked ticket, increases seatCount, and removes the ticket from bookedTickets.

**displayTicket(Scanner scanner):**
Takes user input for a train number and passenger name.
Displays the details of a booked ticket, including train name, train number, passenger name, and seat number.
Main Method:

The main method runs an interactive menu-based interface for users to interact with the Railway Reservation System.
Users can choose from options to view train information, check seat availability, book tickets, cancel tickets, display ticket details, or exit the system.
Overall, this code simulates a basic railway reservation system that allows users to inquire about train details, book and cancel tickets, and view ticket information.
